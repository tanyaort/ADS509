Cher Lyrics

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
Don't say nothing, don't do nothing
He just keeps rolling, he keeps on rolling along
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rolling along
You and me, we sweat and we strain
Our bodies all aching and we're wracked so wracked with pain
Tote that barge and lift, lift that bale
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands, ya lands in jail
I'm weary and I'm sick of trying
I'm scared of living, and I'm scared of dying
And Ol' Man River, he just, he keeps on rolling along, along
