Cher Lyrics

Well see see rider
Well see what you have done, whoa
See see rider, see what you have done
You know you made me love you
Now you're woman's come
Well I'm going to the Hilton
And I know I won't get it
Lord, Lord I'm going to the Hilton
I know I won't get in
But even though
You know I'll still be their friend
Well you gotta love me, gotta love me baby
Hey you gotta love me baby, oh oh whoa oh
You gotta love me baby
Then I'm on the run
Well I'm going away baby
And I won't be back 'til fall. Yeah, yeah
I'm going away baby
I won't be back 'til fall
But if I find me a good man
You know I won't be back at all
I said bye, bye, bye
Bye bye baby
So long, bye bye
Oh bye bye bye baby, bye baby
We'll I'm going away
