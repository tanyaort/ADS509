Cher Lyrics

Where do you go when you're too young?
You found worlds that's just begun
Who's gonna save your days too long?
Or right from wrong? Who can lead you on?
Where do you go? I don't know, ooh
Ask your mom, but right now she's mad
The night before she fought your dad
She'd help you out if she had the time
But your dad is sad and your mother's crying
Where do you go? I don't know, ooh
So you're down on your knees and you hope that helps
You just can't think of nothing else
But how do you pray and what do you say?
When you know right away God showed me the way
Where do you go? I don't know, ooh
