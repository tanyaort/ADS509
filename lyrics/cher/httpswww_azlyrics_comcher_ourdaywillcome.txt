Cher Lyrics

Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me
Our day will come
If we just wait a while
No tears for us
Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
And we'll have everything
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
Will come
Will come
Our day will come
