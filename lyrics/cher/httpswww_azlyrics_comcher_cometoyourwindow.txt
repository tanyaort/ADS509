Cher Lyrics

I'm leaving in the quiet early morning
When night has left the sky, before the dew is dry
But it's not like it used to be
I'm leaving you this warning
You're gonna live to see the day you long for me
Come to your window
It ain't too late to come into your side again
Don't make me leave you
Before you let me have a chance to try again
Or I'll be gone before you ever know you're losing me
I know I've made mistakes that bought you sorrow
But baby, keep in mind you're not right all the time
Don't let me go away to face a new tomorrow
Back where you bought me from when I was glad to come
Come to your window
Look down and see the teardrops in my desperate eyes
Look how I need you
I got to find a way to make you realize
That you are casting out the deepest love you'll ever know
Please don't close your ears to what I'm saying
Before I ride away into the early day
I spent the lonesome evening hours praying
That you will change your mind and try me one more time
Come to your window
Before our love comes crashing into pieces on the ground
Don't let it happen
I promise you this time I'll never let you down
Give me a cause to come to your lonesome arms again
Come to your window
Look down and see the teardrops in my desperate eyes
